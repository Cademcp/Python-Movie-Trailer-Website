# Movie Trailer Website

When this project is run, a tab will open up in the users default web browser. In the tab, an html webpage will display six movie poster images where the user will be able to click on each poster and the designated movie trailer will play.

## Getting Started

In order for this program to run, the following files must be placed into a folder:
	"Favorite Movies"
	"fresh_tomatoes"
	"movie"
The file "Favorite Movies" is the file that will launch the webpage, so the program should be run from this file.

### Prerequisites

The user should install Python version 2. This can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Then open the files using IDLE.

### Installing

Follow the instructions of the Python download. After the installation has completed the files will be able to be opened and run using IDLE. 

## Running the program

To run the "Favorite Movies" file, the user can press "F5" in IDLE, or go to the top and select "Run" and then "Run Module". This will cause a tab to open up in the default browser and the webpage will be displayed.
